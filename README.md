# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-Folder

## Overview of the Analysis/Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title; identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program the company may hold. Summarizing this information should help prepare one of the head managers to prepare for the abundance of people who are expected to retire relatively soon.

- 25916 Senior engineers will retire soon.
- 24926 Senior staff will retire soon.
- 9285 Engineers will retire soon.
- 7636 Staff will retire soon.
- 3603 Technique leaders will retire soon.

## Summary
Overall, there is a grand total of 72,458 people that will retire soon however, there are only 1549 people who qualify for the mentorship program offered. This means that, unless the company makes an attempt to recruit a lot more people through internship programs or just shadowers, the company will face a tremendous dip in their labor force.
